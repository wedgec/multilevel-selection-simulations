###Evolutionary Modeling to Investigate Multilevel Selection Theory as an Explanation for Altruism

This is the repository for my Spring 2017 independent study with 
Professor <a href="http://www.cs.brandeis.edu/~pollack/">Jordan Pollack</a>. 
I am conducting a programming and research project that uses evolutionary simulations to  investigate 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_selection">multi-level 
selection theory</a> as an explanation for altruistic behavior.
